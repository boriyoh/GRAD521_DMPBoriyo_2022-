# Data Description
To collect data, the team will mix fuel grains of the proposed propellant mixtures and burn them in the test stand at the Propulsion laboratory. The test stand is fitting with thermocouples and pressure transducers and combustion pressure sensors to measure the exit temperature and pressure of the nozzle. This data is then inputted into BurnSim, a combustion and dynamics software,  to calculate the thrust and impulse and prepare graphical representation of the impulse during the burn. The temperature and pressure data is taken every second and a thrust and impulse is calculated for each test. 
During the testing, video will be taken of the burn showing the grain, the nozzle, and the flame. Screenshots will be taken before and after the burn as well. Our structures team will want to see if there is any damage to the nozzle and our mixing teams want to make sure the fuel grain is burning properly. The flame is also monitored to make sure it burns evenly and smoothly so that the rocket remains stable and vertical during flight. All the data has not been collected yet. The burn videos will be about 3 GB of video. Screenshots and plots are estimated to be 0.5 GB. Lastly, the raw and intermediate data collected in spreadsheets will be about 100 MB. In total 4 GB is allocated for this work.  

# Roles and responsibilities
The data management plan is implemented by the PI of the project. The team leader and 3 graduate students, including myself have roles in managing the data. 

The Team leader and grad student #2 is in the data manager and they decide what kind of data we need to collect for successful testing and launch. 
Access control is managed by the team leader and the PI. They are the point of contact for google drive/Box access and editing permissions. Because our team is massive and combined with undergrad capstone students, student volunteers, graduate students, professors, and rocket community members, editing permissions are very strict and well managed.  

Grad student #1 and I work on data organization and quality control. This include making sure that the data is formatted consistently and correctly. This can help make inputting data into software easier for other sub-teams and make sure that it is easy to understand for future teams as well. We also make sure that there are sufficient notes on procedure and other important information like air or room pressure, room temp, humidity, drafts, people in the room, which can all affect the data collected, future data to be collected and launch success. 

Instrumentation maintenance is managed by grad student #1 and grad student #2. For our team, this means making sure that all tools in the propulsion lab are clean, properly stored and properly used each time we are there. This also include taking inventory and making sure that there are updated tools lists for launch day. 

Grad student #1 and I work on archiving and preservation. This is similar to other roles, but I specifically keep future teams in mind.  I make sure that all procedures are easy to follow and replicate for future teams to test our experiments and use our data correctly. 

Lastly, all team members work on data analysis and metadata generation. Our work is extremely collaborative, from ideation to data collection and all the way to launch, so this is the best method to have accurate and complete analysis. 

We have two team members working on each data management role for contingency purposes. In case on team members leaves or in unable to do their part for any reason, we have a backup. However, we are very collaborative so all team members know each role well.
