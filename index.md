# Data Description
To collect data, the team will mix fuel grains of the proposed propellant mixtures and burn them in the test stand at the Propulsion laboratory. The test stand is fitting with thermocouples and pressure transducers and combustion pressure sensors to measure the exit temperature and pressure of the nozzle. This data is then inputted into BurnSim, a combustion and dynamics software,  to calculate the thrust and impulse and prepare graphical representation of the impulse during the burn. The temperature and pressure data is taken every second and a thrust and impulse is calculated for each test. 
During the testing, video will be taken of the burn showing the grain, the nozzle, and the flame. Screenshots will be taken before and after the burn as well. Our structures team will want to see if there is any damage to the nozzle and our mixing teams want to make sure the fuel grain is burning properly. The flame is also monitored to make sure it burns evenly and smoothly so that the rocket remains stable and vertical during flight. All the data has not been collected yet. The burn videos will be about 3 GB of video. Screenshots and plots are estimated to be 0.5 GB. Lastly, the raw and intermediate data collected in spreadsheets will be about 100 MB. In total 4 GB is allocated for this work.
