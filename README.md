Data Management Plan for the OSU Rocket Team

Context of the project:
The goal of the team is to design, build and test an experimental rocket to reach the Karman line, the point where we escape the Earthâ€™s atmosphere and technically enter outer space.

Students are in four sub-teams. The propulsion team studies different propellant mixtures, develops the fuel grain, designs the nozzle specifications and motor housing unit. The aerodynamics and recovery team focus on flight calculations such as speed, altitude, and day-of launch conditions. They also design aerodynamic components such as the rocket nose cone and fins. Lastly, the design and monitor the recovery system, which includes manufacturing parachutes, packing them into the rocket correctly and recovering the rocket after launch safely. The structures team focuses on materials and the integration of rocket components ahead of launch. Lastly the avionics team works on the remote ignition system, successful stage separation and flight monitoring. All team must work in tandem to make sure the project goal is achieved and safely executed.
